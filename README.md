# berry-catch-gd4

A simple berry catch minigame, similar to multiple Scratch tutorials I found on YouTube but in Godot and more robust.

The file structure should be compatible with some of my other projects, so to integrate, copy these files onto those files and add a script to link them.

It's not finished yet, but it's a nice starting point.
